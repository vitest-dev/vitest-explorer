# Introduction

You can identify if your config is loaded by the extension with `process.env.VITEST_VSCODE` and change the configuration accordingly.

## Configuration

- `vitest.packagePath`: The path to a custom Vitest's `package.json` file. It will be used to resolve Vitest API paths.
- `vitest.nodeExecutable`: This extension spawns another process and will use this value as `execPath` argument.
- `vitest.nodeEnv`: Environment passed to the runner process in addition to
  `process.env`
- `vitest.debugExclude`: Excludes files matching specified glob patterns from debugging. Default:
  `[\"<node_internals>/**\", \"**/node_modules/**\"]`
