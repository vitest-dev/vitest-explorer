## Features

- **Run**, **debug**, and **watch** Vitest tests in Visual Studio Code.

- A `@open` tag can be used when filtering tests, to only show the tests open in the editor.

- Visual Studio Code version >= July 2021 (version 1.59).

# Introduction

You can identify if your config is loaded by the extension with `process.env.VITEST_VSCODE` and change the configuration accordingly.

## Configuration

- `vitest.enable`: Extension will automatically detect if the current project is using Vitest. If detection fails, extension can be manually enabled via this option.
- `vitest.watchOnStartup`: Whether to activate Watch mode by default when the extension starts.
- `vitest.nodeEnv`: Environment passed to the runner process in addition to
  `process.env`
- `vitest.commandLine`: Command to execute Vitest tests. **It should have the ability
  to append extra arguments**. For example
  `npx vitest` or `yarn test --`. This is a workspace setting. Do not change it in
  the user settings, since it will affect all the projects you open)
- `vitest.debugExclude`: Excludes files matching specified glob patterns from debugging. Default:
  `[\"<node_internals>/**\", \"**/node_modules/**\"]`
